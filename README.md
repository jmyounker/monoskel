Monoskel: An opinionated monorepo
---

This is a skeleton monorepo. It uses the following tooling:

* `git` as the revision control system.
* `bazel` for the build tool.
* `brew` as a package manager on OSX.
* `zsh` as a shell.
* `zgen` to manage shell plugins.
* `lefthook` to manage git hooks.
* `idea` as a development tool.
* `jira` for ticket tracking.
* `confluence` for an external documentation system.

Getting Started
---
By this point you've pulled down the repo, so you've already
got `git`. In the directory where you found this repo, run:
`./bin/init-env`.

After the basic system is stretched out I plan the
following expansions:

* Support for `vscode`.
* Per-language setup:
  * Java
  * Kotlin
  * Python
  * Go
  * JavaScript
  * TypeScript
  * Php
